# Contributing

TreeSpider is still a work-in-progress and I am planning to make it better that it currently is, and your contribution is highly appreciated, and if you need a feature or want to add a tree type, a new chart head, a new link type or any other things you are welcome to contribute them, or if you noticed a bug you're welcome to create a pull request, your contributions are appreciated.
  
## Codebase short intro
  
TreeSpider is fully built with D3 and object oriented TypeScript, and it also uses rollup as the bundler, the source code is under the **src** directory and the output bundle is in the **dist** directory.
  
## Technologies used
  
The following are the technologies used
  
- D3.js
- TypeScript
- SCSS
- rollup
- babel
- jest
  
## Getting started
  
To get started to contribute, in a convenient directory on your computer, open the terminal and clone the [TreeSpider github repository](https://github.com/paulosabayomi/treeSpider), then run `npm i` to install all the dev dependencies, then install `sass` globally with `npm i -g sass`.  
  
## Starting the project
  
To start the project, in the `package.json` file check the list of commands under the `scripts` property for all the commands needed for development and bundling, to start rollup bundler in watch-mode for development run

```bash
npm run rollup-watch
```
  
Next, start the sass css compiler in watch mode by running
  
```bash
npm run sass
```
  
Then you are good to go and to start making changes, the single scss file is under the `/scss` directory.  
  
## Testing
  
After development, testing is neccessary, to test you can either add some test cases to the already created test files under the `/__test__` directory or create new test files, after creating the tests or if no tests were added, run 

```bash
npm run test
```

If all tests passed, then you can create a pull request, no need for bundling as it will be bundled with GitHub Actions after it has been merged.
